# Classification-of-medical-journal
I implemented a KNN classifier to classify text documents to 11 cateogories. These text documents are MEDLINE/PubMed data from https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pmresources.html. These 11 categories are shown in A4Cateogories.txt file. This task is separated into three subtasks which are shown in A4.pdf. The ruuning code are presented in A4.py file. All the final results are shown in A4.txt running with AWS EMR cluster by implementing PySpark.
